## Project Overview

EduKate AI is an innovative AI-driven learning platform designed to enhance education accessibility in rural Africa. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms, we aim to provide personalized, high-quality educational content to students who face significant barriers to traditional learning resources.

## Problem Statement

Children in rural areas of Africa face substantial challenges in accessing quality education:

- Lack of trained instructors
- Limited availability of textbooks and educational materials
- High costs associated with traditional education methods

This results in severe educational disparities. For instance:

- Individuals in Nairobi County have 15.4 times more access to secondary education than those in Turkana County.
- An individual in Embakasi West is 79 times more likely to have access to secondary education than someone in Loima.

1. An AI-powered query and answer system for self-directed learning
2. Personalized responses tailored to each student's learning level
3. Comprehensive coverage of core subjects (mathematics, science, language arts, social studies)
4. Accessibility through various devices (smartphones, tablets, basic computers)
5. Offline functionality to overcome connectivity issues in rural areas
